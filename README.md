A simple ML project to showcase my machine learning skills.

A machine learning application for analyzing and predicting survey results.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Streamlit - A powerful Python library for creating web applications
- **Data Processing**: Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn - For building and training predictive models
- **Data Visualization**: Built-in Streamlit components
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For initial data exploration and model training

## 📁 Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main application entry point
- `explore_page.py`: Data exploration interface
- `predict_page.py`: Prediction interface
- `style.py`: UI styling and configuration
- `survey_results_public.csv`: Survey dataset
- `saved_steps.pkl`: Pre-trained model
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- A web browser

## 💻 Installation Guide

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Baha-Bouazizi/SoftwareDeveloperSalaryPrediction.git
   cd SurveyInsights
   ```

2. **Create a conda environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n ml python
   conda activate ml
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Development Process**
   - Use Jupyter Notebook for initial data exploration and model training
   - Once development is complete, open Visual Studio Code for Streamlit frontend development

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will start a local server and open the application in your default web browser.

## 📝 Development Workflow

The project was developed using the following workflow:
1. Create a conda environment for Python
2. Use Jupyter Notebook for initial data exploration and model training
3. Once development is complete, switch to Visual Studio Code for Streamlit frontend development
4. Finalize the application in VS Code

## 📊 Usage

1. **Exploration Mode**
   - Use the exploration interface to analyze survey data
   - Visualize different aspects of the dataset
   - Filter and segment data as needed

2. **Prediction Mode**
   - Use the prediction interface to make predictions based on the trained model
   - Input your data and get instant predictions
   - View prediction confidence scores

## 🔍 Features

- Interactive data visualization
- Real-time predictions
- User-friendly interface
- Data exploration tools
- Model training and validation

## 📝 Note

- Make sure to have Python 3.8+ installed on your system
- Ensure you have enough RAM to process the dataset
- The application requires internet connection for initial setup but works offline once installed
